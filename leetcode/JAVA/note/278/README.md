# [First Bad Version][title]

## Description

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

## 思路

使用二分查找，需要注意的是，中间值的计算不能使用 (left + right) / 2，这样会造成加法溢出，而应该使用 left + (right - left) / 2。

## 实现代码

```java
/* The isBadVersion API is defined in the parent class VersionControl.
      boolean isBadVersion(int version); */

public class Solution extends VersionControl {
  public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
    int left = 1;
    int right = n;

    while (left < right) {
      int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
      if (isBadVersion(mid)) {
        right = mid;
      } else {
        left = mid + 1;
      }
    }

    return left;
  }
}
```
